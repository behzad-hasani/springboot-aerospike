# Spring Boot Caching with Aerospike

This project demonstrates two approaches to implementing caching in a Spring Boot application using Aerospike:

- Aerospike Repository

- Cache Manager

## Features

- Dual caching mechanism: Showcases how to use Aerospike with both repository-based and cache manager-based approaches in a single application.

- Spring Boot integration: Utilizes Spring Boot's powerful dependency injection and configuration features.

- Aerospike support: Fully integrated with the Aerospike database.

- Easy configuration: Provides examples of setting up the caching layer with minimal effort.

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher.

- Maven or Gradle for dependency management.

- An Aerospike server running locally or accessible from the application.
